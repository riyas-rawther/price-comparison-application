# price-comparison-application
A simple price comparison application built on php, mysql and jquery (jqWidgets). Using this app you can compare price received for a particular item for the day by multiple vendors.

This applicaton ult for a mobile phone tradng company I worked for. But you can customize according to your requirements.

## Example

For example if you have a 10 sales/purchase persons who are getting prices for an item (e.g. Samsung Note <specific model>) from different suppliers. What if one more sales person got another best price from same or another supplier? Without a comparison app or a customized ERP it will be difficult for managing the price.

With this simple datagrid application you can sort, filter and build charts of a specific model or brand (e.g Samsung, Apple, Huwaei).

This application I created on early 2016. Now I am converting the codes to make it compatiblen with latest php version,
